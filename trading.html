                            <p>This story takes you trough our 10 year journey of making Forex trading acessible and
                                easy to understand for everyone.</p>
                            <p><b> Don’t worry we have nothing to sell you here.</b></p>
                            <p>It starts 2 years after we (few finance geeks) lost most of our investments in the
                                2008
                                stock market crash. It was quickly evident that a stock’s future outlook, and the
                                strenght of a company becomes irrelevant when the whole economy goes upside-down.
                            </p>
                            <p> We'd known about Forex but as far as trading goes, most we did was swapping Euros
                                for
                                Thai bath for a week long party in Phuket.</p>
                            <p>It all changed when a banker friend told us about the wild fluctuations of the
                                EUR/USD
                                rate during the financial market crash. It started with 1 EUR being worth $1.30
                                rising
                                to $1.60 before falling to $1.19 towards the end</p>
                            <img src="assets/images/tranding/1.png" alt="">

                            <p> As we learned, Forex traders had made serious bank during the downturn, because
                                currencies are always traded in pairs. When USD crashes, EUR aprreciates against it, and
                                vice virsa.</p>
                            <p> It’s the equivalent of buying a stock and selling its competitor at the same time, just
                                easier, and in this case the companies are countries, and their stock is the currency.
                            </p>
                            <p> We took the bait, and after 2 years of intense study, we decided to share what we had
                                learned with the world by developing a brand-new app called GoForex, which many have
                                since unsuccessfully attempted to copy. GoForex is a simple and accessible guide to
                                forex trading for those who want to try their hand at the largest and most liquid market
                                in the world.</p>

                            <p> Today hundreds of “learn trading” apps have tried to copy our innovative features such

                                    require our attention(like trading many assets ) we become less efficient and more
                                    likely to make a mistake.”
